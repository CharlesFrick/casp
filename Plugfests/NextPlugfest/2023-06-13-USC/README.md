# To Participate
To participate,
[participate in the CASP mailing list, and attend the CASP meetings](https://lists.oasis-open-projects.org/g/oca-casp).

The event will be hybrid.
It is likely we will be space-limited 
at the physical event at USC.
USC has kindly allowed us the use of a classroom
(seats appx ??).
Should more people register
(see ??? for registration details)
than fit, we will be using "sweat equity"
to determine physical attendance
(see ?? sweat equity).

Note the CASP event is the day before, 
and in the same venue as, 
the CISA SBOMarama.
