# Graphing Results

The intent is to create quick visuals representing
the interworking acheived at this plugfest.

## Overall
The hope is the overall results will look something like:

![results](../../../../Images/BigPictureConnections.png)

## Technologies / Organizations
The overall graph will be created by combining results from 
individual use cases based on 
![technologies](../../../../Images/CASP_technologies.png)
and
![orgs](../../../../Images/CASP_orgs2.png)
with some annotations:
![annotations](../../../../Images/annotations.png)
using hypothetical (although hopefully will be actual) examples from the next section.

## Use Cases
blah blah explaining overall and then listing usecases:
* 1
* 2
* ...
  
Intent is graphs like below would actually be in the
[Sweat Equity](../SweatEquity/README.md)
section prior to plugfest and copied into this section
once demonstrated at plugfest.
For now, they are hypothetical examples.
It is also intended that better graphing software will be used.

### IBM Ransomware
This is a hypothetical example to show how this works.

![ibm1](../../../../Images/graph_ibm_1.png)
The above graph shows what IBM has working within 
what it will bring to event (the IBM-IBM arc)
and what technologies it supports:
* STIX, STIX Shifter, Kestrel is working software talking among themselves machine2machine using standard CASP interfaces
* using CACAO with some hand waving

### HII Ransomware
In this hypothetical example,
![hii1](../../../../Images/graph_hii_1.png),
HII shows what it has working among it's software.

### HII/IBM Ransomware
In this hypothetical example, HII and IBM get their software
interworking with each other as part of a broader 
ransomware attack example.

### sFractal Ransomware / Comply-to-Connect
In this example, sFractal uses the comply-to-connect usecase
from previous plugfests and combines it
with the ransomware usecase by HII and IBM. 
In this example sFractal software only interfaces
with other sFractal software so it contains a combination of
machine-to-machine, hand-waving, and human interaction

### HII/IBM/MITRE/Sekoia/sFractal Meta use case
It gets nearer to the intended graph
when the sFractal interfaces to Blink/Twinkly  
are connected to the HII OIF interfaces,
and the MITRE IoB interfaces are added,
and the Sekoia OXA interfaces are added,
and the etc., etc., etc.
