Content:

- A [VEX](ecv-2024-0001.json) created by Example Company PSIRT regarding the WitchyWashy vulnerabilities - share just hours after the information has been published by Murphyâ€™s Law LLP. As they have a proper vulnerability management, they are able to provide a fast determination of affected and not affected product as well as fixes. This would also be share on our CSAF Aggregator.

They created the VEX straight from the incoming information and started their investigation with potential affected products. This would also be share on our CSAF Aggregator.
