# Value Propositions

This represents the highest of three levels of value propositions. 
In this context, we will provide value propositions oriented towards business stakeholders.

blah blah explaining why this layer and then list ones we have with links

  * [Wishywashy Ransomware](./WishyWashy)
  * [StarMal Invoice Hijack](./StarMal) 
  * Payroll hijack
    You've really got to be on your toes in an industry like car rental when your
    company has locations scattered all around the western world. Sure, Cheap-O
    has a great reputation and there are some really sterling district managers
    in the company. Unfortunately, there is also Duane at the Kansas City office.
    Duane's behavior, though questionable at times, isn't fireable. That's coming
    from HR, who would love Duane to cut it out with the blue jokes and stop using
    his work phone to scour questionable corners of the internet. Maybe, just maybe,
    if Duane hadn't been aggressively catfished at the District Manager annual meeting
    in Vegas, hackers wouldn't have gained access to the payroll processing software.
    Then Duane and all the other Cheap-O employees who didn't get paid this month, because
    the company's entire outgoing payroll went to a hacker named Lux who is currently
    living high on the hog in parts unknown, wouldn't have walked off the job to lodge
    various interstate lawsuits against Cheap-O while abandoning the vital day-to-day
    car rental business that keep the company in liquid assets. Thanks Duane.
     
  * Billing hijack
    There was a script somewhere that somebody missed. Something unforseen and
    deeply unfortunate burrowed its way into the AllHome billing system. The guys in
    IT only figured it out after a record number of policies lapsed in a ninety day period.
    Rates had gone up, sure, but not to the point that one hundred percent of those who
    were due to renew their policies should have left AllHome. Especially not with the cutesy
    ads with that actor from that TV show that the company had spent beaucoup bucks on. Exit
    surveys were definitive: 100% of those who had allowed their policy to lapse thought they had
    paid and were still policy holders with AllHome. Whoops. Some financial forensics made IT's stomach
    drop. These customers had, indeed, paid someone. Just not AllHome. 

  * BEC
     BUSINESS EMAIL COMPROMISE
    Bert Transome had more than just an MBA from a school most would give their eye teeth to attent.
    He also had the suit, the car, the house, the resume, the handshake, and the chin, which
    was really a remarkable and under-complimented feature. He also had the ego and a certain
    flippant lack of restraint. So Bert Transome played it fast and loose with his email at a
    speaking engagement and got a couple curious emails over the next few days. The content made
    enough sense, so he clicked the link, which didn't work, and he proceeded to forget all about it.
    Then Anthony, Bert's unquestioningly loyal assistant and the keeper of his vaunted calendar received
    an equally curious email from Bert asking him to make a reservation for him at a restaurant
    he had linked. When Anthony clicked to make Bert a noon lunch at Mal Movimiento in Manhattan,
    the browser was blank. Six months later, Anthony is standing in front of Bert, who is on a video
    call with the Board attempting to explain why his company has undertaken a massive CapX procurement
    campaign to the tune of vital billions. Anthony's career as a yes man is likely over. It's so bad
    that even Bert Transmore might have to find a new gig. 
    
  * Lepus Sun Gust Supply Chain Attack
    If we're being honest, the State's Department of Voter Records doesn't really "do" computers.
    They've got their vendors and the vendors treat them well and its never been a problem.
    Lepus, for instance. Great group of people. Super professional. Always there to field a
    problem. They're software, MOONZEPHYR, is pretty neat. Everyone at DVR agrees that it's
    been a game changer. Moonzephyr is a quick and easy way to store and share records with a few
    clicks. Even Mark, the dunce from Washington County, really loves it. Best of all--Lepus guarantees
    that the information stored on Moonzephyr is safe from compromise. It's an awesome assurance.
    Unfortunately, it's not true. A group of guys with state-funding half a world away took a little time
    and found a back door into Moonzephyr. They already had cash in the bank, and the guy who paid for
    the job wasn't about to waste this access on a little ransom. So they've just been collecting data
    on all the state's voters for a couple of election cycles now. No one, not even Mark, the dunce from
    Washington County, knows any better. Cool data, really. Could come in handy some day.
