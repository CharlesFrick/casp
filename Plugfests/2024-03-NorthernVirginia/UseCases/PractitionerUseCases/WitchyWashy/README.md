The [Value Propositions](../ValuePropositions/README.md)provide value propositions oriented towards business stakeholders ie less geeky than the practioner use cases at this level.

These practioner use cases get into the actual details. For example the WitchyWashy Ransomware Value Propostion says:

Triumvirate CleanUp Inc, also a subscriber to their ISAC,
analyzes the STIX bundle and decides to use their PACE system to
analyze their environment (*H) and see if they are vulnerable to the
same attack that targeted Murphyâ€™s Law and On Deck. 

The *H is a link to a practioner use case on actually doing that analysis.
