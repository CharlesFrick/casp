# Sweat Equity

See [FAQ on Sweat Equity](../faq.md#what-is-sweat-equity) for how we are defining sweat equity.

See [FAQ on physical attendance eligiblity](../faq.md#how-will-physical-attendance-be-determined) for how sweat equity 
affects physical attendance eligiblility.

For examples of visualization of sweat equity interactions, see 
[graphing results](./graphing_results.md).

The intent of this sweat equity page is for organizations
to announce prior to the meeting
what resources they will be bringing to the meeting.

This will be organized three different ways:
* by organization (e.g. HII, IBM, NSA, sFractal, etc)
* by techology (e.g. Kestrel, OpenC2, PACE, SBOM, etc)
* by use case (e.g. ransomware, comply-to-connect, BEC, etc)

The primary focus should be on organization 
i.e. companies/agencies supplying content of what they will be supplying.
See [FAQ on contributing sweat equity](../faq.md#how-do-i-document-the-sweat-equity-our-organization-will-provide)
for how to do that. 
Organizations are encouraged to also provide a video. 
See [FAQ on videos](../faq.md#can-i-contribute-a-video-about-my-company-contribution)

Once organization contribs are in, 
we can collectively fill in the tecnology and use cases
i.e. if HII, IBM, and sFractal interact with OpenC2
in a ransomware use case,
then we can put text/links in OpenC2 and Ransomware
reflecting that.

See [FAQ on documenting sweat equity](../faq.md#how-do-i-document-the-sweat-equity-our-organization-will-provide)
for process of documenting your sweat equity.
