You've really got to be on your toes in an industry like car rental 
when your company has locations scattered all around the western world. 
Sure, Cheap-O has a great reputation and there are some really sterling 
district managers in the company. Unfortunately, there is also Duane 
at the Kansas City office. Duane's behavior, though questionable at times, isn't fireable. 
That's coming from HR, who would love Duane to cut it out with the blue jokes and stop 
using his work phone to scour questionable corners of the internet. 
Maybe, just maybe, if Duane hadn't been aggressively catfished at the District Manager annual meeting in Vegas, 
hackers wouldn't have gained access to the payroll processing software. 
Then Duane and all the other Cheap-O employees who didn't get paid this month, 
because the company's entire outgoing payroll went to a hacker named Lux who is currently living high on the hog in parts unknown, 
wouldn't have walked off the job to lodge various interstate lawsuits against Cheap-O 
while abandoning the vital day-to-day car rental business that keep the company in liquid assets. 
Thanks Duane.
