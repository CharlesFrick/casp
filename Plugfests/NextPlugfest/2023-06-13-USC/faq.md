# Frequently Asked Questions about this CASP event

## What about broader questions about cybersecurity automation?
See the 
[overall CASP FAQ](../../CASP-FAQ.md)
for questions 
about CASP, or cybersecurity automation, overall.

## Are there any restrictions on attending?
The event is open to all if they agree to 
register and they agree to abide by the 
[Code of Conduct](../../../../CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md)
which TL;DR is "don't be a jerk".

There is no cost for attending.

Anyone may attend virtually.
Because of limited space
(unless someone volunteers to pay for a larger space),
physical attendance may be limited.
See {add link to other question} 
[how-will-physical-attendance-be-determined](./faq.md#how-will-physical-attendance-be-determined)
for process on 
determining physical attendance.

## What are logistics of attending virtually?
See [logistics](./logistics.md)

## What are logistics of attending physically?
See [logistics](./logistics.md)

## How will physical attendance be determined?
Assuming space limitations prevent everyone from fitting,
attendance will be determined by 
one person per organization and then by sweat equity.

Governance will be via CASP governance procedures.

## What is "sweat equity"?
Sweat equity in this context (ie for determining physical attendance) is mainly:
* working software as part of demoable CASP use cases
but may also consider a combination of:
* attendance at CASP meetings
* contributions via CASP mailing list
* contributions to CASP github (ie this repo)
* attendance at previous plugfests
* keynote speakers
* contributions to CASP-related projects (Kestrel, PACE, IoB, OpenC2, STIX, CSAF/VEX, ... ).

## Can I contribute a video about my company contribution?
Yes, it is encouraged. See [videos](./SweatEquity/video_list.md)
