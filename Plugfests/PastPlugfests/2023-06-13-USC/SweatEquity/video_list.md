# Videos
This will eventually contain a list of the video
contributed by organizations participating.

Videos are encouraged from both the contributing organizations
(i.e. companies, agencies, etc)
and from/about technologies (i.e. Kestrel, OpenC2, PACE, STIX, ...).

The requirements below were instituted based on learnings
from previous CASP events.
Videos from the most previous CASP events can be found at:
* [add link here](add link here).
* [add link here](add link here).

## Requirements
Video requirements:
* must be 3 minutes or less
* must be a link to a youtube or otherwise publicly accessible
* must have been provided to the CASP planning team (by email to CASP mailling list) by end-of-day Thursday, June 8th, so that links to videos may be posted, and people have time to watch prior to June 13th
* may contain mention of company name and value proposition but can't be a blatant marketing pitch. Must contain connection to CASP, and ideally to specific CASP use cases. Remember focus is on interworking and value proposition of standardized interfaces in cybersecurity automation. "A incoming tide raises all boats". Promote your value, do not denigrate your competitors. Any videos disparaging competitors will be rejected.

The intent is to just publish the list here and participants should watch
**prior** to event (as well as read the 
[sweat equity section](../SweatEquity/README.md)) 
so everyone knows what everyone else is bringing.
