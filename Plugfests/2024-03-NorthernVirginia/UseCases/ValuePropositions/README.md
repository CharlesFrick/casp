In this context, we will provide value propositions oriented towards business stakeholders.

     BUSINESS EMAIL COMPROMISE
    Bert Transome had more than just an MBA from a school most would give their eye teeth to attent.
    He also had the suit, the car, the house, the resume, the handshake, and the chin, which
    was really a remarkable and under-complimented feature. He also had the ego and a certain
    flippant lack of restraint. So Bert Transome played it fast and loose with his email at a
    speaking engagement and got a couple curious emails over the next few days. The content made
    enough sense, so he clicked the link, which didn't work, and he proceeded to forget all about it.
    Then Anthony, Bert's unquestioningly loyal assistant and the keeper of his vaunted calendar received
    an equally curious email from Bert asking him to make a reservation for him at a restaurant
    he had linked. When Anthony clicked to make Bert a noon lunch at Mal Movimiento in Manhattan,
    the browser was blank. Six months later, Anthony is standing in front of Bert, who is on a video
    call with the Board attempting to explain why his company has undertaken a massive CapX procurement
    campaign to the tune of vital billions. Anthony's career as a yes man is likely over. It's so bad
    that even Bert Transmore might have to find a new gig. 
    
  * Lepus Sun Gust Supply Chain Attack
    If we're being honest, the State's Department of Voter Records doesn't really "do" computers.
    They've got their vendors and the vendors treat them well and its never been a problem.
    Lepus, for instance. Great group of people. Super professional. Always there to field a
    problem. They're software, MOONZEPHYR, is pretty neat. Everyone at DVR agrees that it's
    been a game changer. Moonzephyr is a quick and easy way to store and share records with a few
    clicks. Even Mark, the dunce from Washington County, really loves it. Best of all--Lepus guarantees
    that the information stored on Moonzephyr is safe from compromise. It's an awesome assurance.
    Unfortunately, it's not true. A group of guys with state-funding half a world away took a little time
    and found a back door into Moonzephyr. They already had cash in the bank, and the guy who paid for
    the job wasn't about to waste this access on a little ransom. So they've just been collecting data
    on all the state's voters for a couple of election cycles now. No one, not even Mark, the dunce from
    Washington County, knows any better. Cool data, really. Could come in handy some day.
