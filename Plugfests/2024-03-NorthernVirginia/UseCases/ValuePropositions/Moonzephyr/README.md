If we're being honest, the State's Department of Voter Records doesn't really "do" computers.
    They've got their vendors and the vendors treat them well and its never been a problem.
    Lepus, for instance. Great group of people. Super professional. Always there to field a
    problem. They're software, MOONZEPHYR, is pretty neat. Everyone at DVR agrees that it's
    been a game changer. Moonzephyr is a quick and easy way to store and share records with a few
    clicks. Even Mark, the dunce from Washington County, really loves it. Best of all--Lepus guarantees
    that the information stored on Moonzephyr is safe from compromise. It's an awesome assurance.
    Unfortunately, it's not true. A group of guys with state-funding half a world away took a little time
    and found a back door into Moonzephyr. They already had cash in the bank, and the guy who paid for
    the job wasn't about to waste this access on a little ransom. So they've just been collecting data
    on all the state's voters for a couple of election cycles now. No one, not even Mark, the dunce from
    Washington County, knows any better. Cool data, really. Could come in handy some day.
