The administration staff at Carter Branch Hospital pride
themselves on offering medical services that are a cut above.
Unfortunately, staffing surgeons and tamping down staph infections
are a touch more clear cut than the sutble network intrusion that was
only discovered too late. When the annual third party financial audit
of Carter Branch's finances attempted to get to the bottom of ballooning
costs for basic medical supplies, a curious series of invoices appeared.
Tens of thousands of dollars were being paid out on a semi-monthly basis
to a cryptic vendor named Star Med with an offshore routing number.
No bill of materials for good delivered were to be found and a subsequent
inventory of Carter Branch's supply room revealed no wares from Star Med.
In accounting, no one could offer anything in the way of an explanation. The
invoice had simply appeared one day in their system and had been paid
accordingly. A final tally revealed a ballpark of $300,000 paid for nothing.
