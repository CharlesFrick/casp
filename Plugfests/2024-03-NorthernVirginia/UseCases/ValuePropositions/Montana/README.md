There was a script somewhere that somebody missed. Something unforseen and deeply unfortunate burrowed its way into the AllHome billing system. The guys in IT only figured it out after a record number of policies lapsed in a ninety day period. Rates had gone up, sure, but not to the point that one hundred percent of those who were due to renew their policies should have left AllHome. Especially not with the cutesy ads with that actor from that TV show that the company had spent beaucoup bucks on. Exit surveys were definitive: 100% of those who had allowed their policy to lapse thought they had paid and were still policy holders with AllHome. Whoops. Some financial forensics made IT's stomach drop. These customers had, indeed, paid someone. Just not AllHome.
