# Cybersecurity Automation SubProject (CASP)

The [Open Cybersecurity Alliance (OCA)](https://opencybersecurityalliance.org/)
Cybersecurity Automation SubProject (CASP) 
is comprised of global like-minded cybersecurity vendors, end users, 
thought leaders and individuals who are interested in cybersecurity automation.

It is a forum where products from all vendors, researchers, and software publishers can freely exchange information, insights, and reference implementations via commonly developed code and tooling, using mutually agreed upon technologies, specifications, and procedures.

CASP is co-chaired by Bret Jordan and Duncan Sparrell. 
Jane Ginn is the CASP secretary.

See the [CASP Home Page](https://lists.oasis-open-projects.org/g/oca-casp)
for the mailing list, calendar, etc.
See [Events](./Events.md) for events organized by CASP.
