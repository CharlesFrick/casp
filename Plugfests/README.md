### Test Planning

Because plugfests exercise interworking among independent implementations, it's helpful for
participants to register interest in testing specific protocols with other participants.
If you are considering participating, please use the CASP mailing list or GitHub issue to request
to be added to the [test matrix](Plugfests/2024-03-NorthernVirginia/test-matrix-2024-03.md),
or edit it directly and submit a GitHub pull request.
